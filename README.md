# BookClub

BookClub is my initial exploration of long form reading and typography in the browser. After reading some interesting thoughts on the topic from iA and Craig Mod I decided to try my hand at creating a better reading experience on a desktop browser. Eventually I would like to optimize this for iOS as well.

## To Do
*Write script to generate/clone the correct number of pages based on the scrollWidth of the article element
*Look into lazy loading pages and deleting any elements that overflow to minimize the number of repeated DOM elements
