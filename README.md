This is an initial exploration in long form reading and typography in the browser. After reading some interesting thoughts on the topic from iA and Craig Mod I decided to try my hand at creating a better reading experience on a desktop browser. Eventually this will be optimized for use on iOS, though I feel that platform will be less challenging than a desktop browser.
